Detailed Manual Steps Summary
If you prefer doing it manually without the scripts, here is the verified workflow for Windows 11 (2026):
Install & Fix Service (Target):
Install OpenSSH Server via Settings > Optional Features.
If sshd fails to start, delete C:\ProgramData\ssh and reinstall.
Firewall & Profile (Target):
Ensure the Network Profile is set to Private.
Add a firewall rule for Port 22.
Generate Key (Source):
Run ssh-keygen -t ed25519.
Manual Authorization (For Passwordless):
Copy the contents of id_ed25519.pub from the Source PC.
On the Target PC, paste it into C:\ProgramData\ssh\administrators_authorized_keys.
Crucial: Run icacls to grant Full Control to SYSTEM and Administrators, and disable inheritance. Windows will ignore the key if any other user has access to this file.
Transfer:
Run scp -r "SourcePath" username@IP:"DestinationPath".
Final Transfer Command for your current setup:
To move the folder now that keys are set:
scp -r "C:\Users\shrey\OneDrive\Documents\Code\Gemma\RPX\sut_client" zel-x4@192.168.0.103:"C:\Code"
