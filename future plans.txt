explore openssh -> what capabilities can be used 
And ipmessenger to implement in sut-client

4 resolutions across 4 graphics presets - complete
change windows resolution - complete 
copy tracing packages from master to sut if unavailable 
disable start automation until frontend receives all information from the sut - max display support, pc name, games installed , platform, sku, tracing available?, etc - complete
schedule runs on a busy SUT to execute later
schedule runs to execute later or on a event occurrence 
single, batch, campaign - complete
Add spotify's add to queue functionality
Add change order of execution on the fly functionality

Add partial FSM - for each game draw out the entire menu (each options shows what) - based on that the automation can understand where it is and where it needs to go.

Temp Steam Accounts Feature (2026-01-09)
========================================
Allow using personal/temporary Steam accounts for automation runs.
These accounts may require Steam Guard authentication (code or QR).

Implementation requirements:
1. Frontend acknowledgment dialog - user must confirm before each run that they will handle authentication
2. Steam Guard code entry - if Steam asks for a code, show an input field in frontend to enter the 6-digit code
   - SUT client needs endpoint to detect if Steam is asking for code (screenshot + OmniParser)
   - SUT client needs endpoint to type the code into Steam
3. Steam Guard QR code display - if Steam shows QR code for login:
   - SUT client captures screenshot of QR code
   - Frontend displays the QR code for user to scan with Steam mobile app
   - Poll for successful login completion
4. Account pool integration - add "temp" or "personal" account type to account pool
   - Don't auto-retry with these accounts on conflict
   - Mark as "requires_interaction" in account config
5. Timeline events for Steam Guard states:
   - STEAM_GUARD_CODE_REQUIRED
   - STEAM_GUARD_QR_REQUIRED
   - STEAM_GUARD_WAITING_USER
   - STEAM_GUARD_COMPLETED

Related: "No Steam Login" feature (skip_steam_login) was implemented as alternative for users who pre-login manually.
